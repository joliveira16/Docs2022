<p>We are now going to look at returns of actual stock and bond portfolios.
The two portfolios are <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI">VTI</a> and
<a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/BND">BND</a>.
These are value-weighted exchange traded funds (ETFs).
VTI tracks a stock market index and BND tracks a bond market index.
They are good proxies for the return of the overall US stock and bond markets.</p>
<p>We are going to load some helper code that allows us to download and plot this data.
This will introduce using <code>#load</code> to load scripts with external code,
the <code>nuget</code> package manager for loading external libraries,
and how to open namespaces.</p>
<p>When you type <code>#load "Script.fsx"</code> in the REPL,
F# interactive compiles the code in <code>Script.fsx</code> and puts it into
a code module with the same name as the script.</p>
<p>We are going to use a helper script called <code>YahooFinance.fsx</code> that includes
code for requesting price histories from yahoo. To download it,
go to the <a href="YahooFinance.html">YahooFinance</a> page and click the "download script"
button at the top. Make sure that you have saved it in
the same directory as this file.</p>
<p>If you have downloaded it correctly then the following code will evaluate to <code>true</code>.</p>
<pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs12', 21)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs12', 21)" class="id">System</span><span class="pn">.</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs13', 22)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs13', 22)" class="id">IO</span><span class="pn">.</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs14', 23)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs14', 23)" class="rt">File</span><span class="pn">.</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs15', 24)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs15', 24)" class="id">Exists</span><span class="pn">(</span><span class="s">&quot;YahooFinance.fsx&quot;</span><span class="pn">)</span>
</code></pre>
<table class="pre"><tr><td><pre><code>true</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Assuming that the above code evaluated to <code>true</code> we can now load it into our session.</p>
<pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="pp">#load</span> <span class="s">&quot;YahooFinance.fsx&quot;</span>

<p>Namespaces are a hierarchical way of organizing code.
In the above checking for the existence of a file we have a hierarchy of
<code>System.IO</code> where the period <code>.</code> separates the <code>System</code> and <code>IO</code> namespaces.
If we <code>open</code> a namespace, then we have access to the code inside the namespace directly.</p>
<p>It is common to open the <code>System</code> namespace.</p>
<pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">open</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs12', 25)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs12', 25)" class="id">System</span>

<p>We also want to open the <code>YahooFinance</code> module from <code>YahooFinance.fsx</code>,
which is similar to a namespace.</p>

<p>We are ready to request some data. Let's define our start and end dates.
<code>DateTime</code> is a type in the <code>System</code> namespace.

<p>The adjusted close is adjusted for stock splits and dividends.
This adjustment is done so that you can calculate returns from the price changes.</p>
<p>Let's see what it looks like to plot it.
We're going to use the <a href="https://plotly.net">plotly.NET</a> library for this.
We download the code from the <a href="http://www.nuget.org">nuget.org</a> package manager.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to loading libraries with <code>pip</code> or <code>conda</code> in python
or <code>install.packages</code> in R.</p>

<p>Ok, back to the main objective. We need to calculate returns.
We calculate returns from sequential days,
so we need to make sure that our data is sorted correctly
from the oldest to the newest data. We can do this with <code>List.Sort</code>.</p>

<p>Remember that with continuous compounding, <span class="math">\(FV_T = PV_t \times e^{r}\)</span>
where <span class="math">\(FV\)</span> is the future value, <span class="math">\(PV\)</span> is the present value, <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is return
between period <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we take the log of both sides of the equation, we get</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ log(FV) = log(PV) + r \rightarrow log(FV) - log (PV) = r\]</span></p>
<p>This <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is known as the log return.
So to find the log return between two periods we can take the
difference of the log prices (where the prices are adjusted for dividends).</p>
